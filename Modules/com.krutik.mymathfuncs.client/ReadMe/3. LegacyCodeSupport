Support for legacy code is provided by two key features.

Unnamed Module:

When you use code that is not part of a named module, it automatically becomes part of the unnamed module.
The unnamed module has two important attributes:

1. All of the packages in the unnamed module are automatically exported.
2. The unnamed module can access any and all other modules.

Thus, when a program does not use modules, all API modules in the Java platform are automatically accessible 
through the unnamed module.

The second key feature that supports legacy code is the automatic use of the class path, rather than the 
module path. When you compile a program that does not use modules, the class path mechanism is employed, 
just as it has been since Java’s original release. As a result, the program is compiled and run in the 
same way it was prior to JDK 9.
