By modularizing the API, it becomes possible to
deploy an application with only the packages that it requires, rather than the entire
Java Runtime Environment (JRE). Because of the size of the full JRE, this is a very
important improvement.

Of the platform modules, the most important is java.base
It includes and exports those packages fundamental to Java, such as java.lang, java.io, and java.util,
among many others. 
Because of its importance, java.base is automatically accessible to all modules.

In much the same way that java.lang is automatically available to all programs without the use of an 
import statement, the java.base module is automatically accessible to all module-based programs without 
explicitly requesting it.
