Consider a situation in which there are three modules, A, B, and C, that have the following dependences:
		A requires B
		B requires C
Given this situation, it is clear that since A depends on B and B depends on C, A has an indirect dependence on C.

In such scenario you can create an implied dependence on C.  Implied dependence is also referred to as implied readability.

To create an implied dependence, add the transitive keyword after requires in
the clause that requires the module upon which an implied readability is needed.

module B {
	exports somepack;
	requires transitive C;
}
