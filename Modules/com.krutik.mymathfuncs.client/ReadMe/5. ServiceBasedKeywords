Modules support services through the use of the keywords provides, uses, and with.

a module specifies that it provides a service with a provides statement.
A module indicates that it requires a service with a uses statement. 
The specific type of service provider is declared by with. 

When used together, they enable you to specify a module that provides a service, a module that needs 
that service, and the specific implementation of that service.

syntax:
	provides serviceType with implementationTypes

	serviceType specifies the type of the service, which is often an interface,
	although abstract classes are also used. A comma-separated list of the
	implementation types is specified by implementationTypes.

syntax:	
uses serviceType;
	serviceType specifies the type of the service required.
